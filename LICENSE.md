## Open-Source Code Acquisition Statement

>This project makes use of open-source code, libraries, and assets that were acquired before February 5th, 2025. **All referenced open-source materials were used in compliance with their respective licenses at the time of acquisition.**

**We acknowledge the importance of respecting the licensing terms of open-source contributions and recognize that open-source authors may update or change their licensing terms at any time, with or without prior notice. If any open-source assets used in this project later become non-commercial or otherwise restricted from redistribution, we, as the maintainers and contributors of this project, will approach such changes with a willingness to comply.**

Therefore, in the spirit of respecting the work of open-source contributors, if your or your organization's open-source code was used without complying with your terms of use, we will:

- **Evaluate** the impact of the new licensing terms.
- **Seek permission** or an alternative licensing agreement, if appropriate.
- **Modify, replace, or remove** affected assets if continued use is not permitted.
- **Provide proper attribution,** if the new terms require it, or if your work was not previously credited correctly.

>This statement is made in good faith to ensure the ethical and respectful use of open-source resources while maintaining the integrity of this project.
>**If you believe that your work has been used in a way that does not align with its licensing terms, please contact us, and we will make every reasonable effort to resolve the matter in a fair and cooperative manner**
